        <p class="left doble">The king (♔,♚)</p>
        <p>
        A king can move one square in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or
        diagonally) unless the square is already occupied by a friendly piece or
        the move would place the king in check.
        </p>
        <p>The queen (♕, ♛)</p>
        <p>
        The queen can be moved any number of unoccupied squares in a straight line
        vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, thus combining the moves of the
        rook and bishop.
        </p>
        <p class="right dosTercios">The bishop (♗,♝)</p>
        <p>
        The bishops may be differentiated according to which wing they begin on,
        i.e. the king's bishop and queen's bishop. As a consequence of its
        diagonal movement, each bishop always remains on either the white or black
        squares, and so it is also common to refer to them as light-squared or
        dark-squared bishops.
        </p>
        <p class="dosTercios">The knight (♘,♞)</p>
        <p>
        The knight move is unusual among chess pieces. It moves to a square that
        is two squares away horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares
        vertically and one square horizontally. The complete move therefore looks
        like the letter "L". Unlike all other standard chess pieces, the knight
        can "jump over" all other pieces (of either color) to its destination
        square.
        </p>
        <p class="left">The rook (♖,♜)</p>
        <p>
        The rook moves horizontally or vertically, through any number of
        unoccupied squares (see diagram).
        </p>
        <p>The pawn (♙,♟)</p>
        <p>
        Unlike the other pieces, pawns cannot move backwards. Normally a pawn
        moves by advancing a single square, but the first time a pawn moves, it
        has the option of advancing two squares.
